    "# Image Recognition Software for a Web app\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "We developed a free food-finding app during HackMT where anybody can search for free food around them just by entering their location, and anybody can donate their food just by filling in information about the food type and quantity they are offering. Currently, the food donor has to fill this information every time they are hosting food. We are going to incorporate an image recognition neural network into this web app to determine the food information automatically from pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will eliminate the form filling process, and reduce the amount of work required to donate food. The app we are improving is built to prevent food wastage and also to provide food to someone who needs it without paying for it. The image recognition feature will add great value to the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset contains images of different food types. It is a 5GB dataset with 101 food categories including breakfast, lunch, and dessert for different cuisine. The images are of 3 color channels. It was used for the research paper \"Food-101 – Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests\" by Lukas Bossard [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to perform web scraping to collect more data. Depending on the data we receive from web scraping, we will decide on how generalized our classification is going to be. The most important part of our project is to collect an ample amount of data and modify and label it according to our classification.\n",
    "Image scaling, normalization, dimension reduction, and data augmentation methods such as cropping, scaling, or rotation are some of the data manipulation processes we may use, considering the size of the images, the total number of images, number of channels, and their aspect ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We are planning on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images. CNNs are efficient in correlating and understanding a large amount of data in high-resolution images, and they are best known for their ability to recognize patterns present in images.\n",
    "The goal is to train a CNN to be as accurate as possible in identifying different cuisines and their servings, this model will then be implemented as a web app using React-js on the front end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tests\n",
    "Testing is the second priority of our project. We will be following a proper test protocol for the classification tasks.\n",
    "To estimate the skill of our model on the new data we are going to follow a k-fold cross-validation procedure, we'll be using scikit-learn libraries for this, it provides train/test indices to split data into train/test sets and to split the dataset into k consecutive folds. This provides further confidence in our model's ability to generalize.\n",
    "We will consider metrics such as accuracy, false-positive rate (FPR), true positive rate (TPR), and area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) to quantify the quality of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also monitor these metrics per-epoch during training using TensorBoard (TensorFlow’s visualization suite).\n",
