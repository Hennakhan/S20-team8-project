### Food Recognition Software for a Web App

Abstract - Image classification is the task of classifying an image into a class category. In this paper, we developed three food classifier models, namely Model-1, Model-2, and Model-3, that can classify the image into 101, 50, and 25 food categories, respectively. We have used a Convolutional neural network for this purpose. Since CNN's are efficient in correlating and understanding a large amount of data in high-resolution images, they are best known for their ability to recognize patterns present in images. Our Model-1 is deployed to a Food recognizer web app.
